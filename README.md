# Flower-Mandala

I am new to C#, Xamarin, and XAML and am flying blind writing this program. I posted code here months ago but my repos and profile image disappeared. I also included a few images that my app creates. I use some math with SkiaSharp to create designs such as the one I included Clip1.png. I've only posted some of my code. I'm a bit embarrassed by its simplicity. I like to say that the central algorithm is simple yet elegant.
